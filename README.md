## Getting Started
Open the file 0-main.scd in SuperCollider. Follow the instructions there to evaluate the code.

## Prerequisites
1. Download SuperCollider (https://supercollider.github.io/).

## Testing
This code was made using SuperCollider 3.8.0 on a computer running MacOSX 10.14. Although not intended for widespread use, it may work on Windows and Linux machines, depending mostly on the cross-platform implementation of certain Supercollider functions especially Image.
